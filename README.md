# Automatic-File-Sorter-in-File-Explorer
This project is a Python script that helps automatically sort files in a folder based on their file types. It organizes files into different subfolders such as Documents, Images, Videos, Music, Archives, and Others.

**How It Works**
1. The script scans a selected folder.
2. It identifies file types based on extensions (e.g., .pdf, .jpg, .mp4).
3. It creates subfolders for each category if they don't exist.
4. It moves the files into their respective subfolders.
